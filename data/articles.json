Firstly, we derive the superclose property of the interpolation function. Then a superconvergence result of O(h^3/2)-order for the pressure approximation and the velocity gradient approximation under the condition of strong regular mesh triangulation are obtained. Finally, the superconvergence rate of O(h^3)-order is proved for the eigenvalue approximation and the numerical experiment is provided to confirm the theoretical analysis.",

This new method is based on multiscale enrichment, and is derived from the Stokes eigenvalue problem itself. The convergence of this new stabilized method is proved and the optimal priori error estimates for the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are also obtained. Moreover, we combine this new stabilized finite element method with the two-level method to give a new two-level stabilized finite element method for the Stokes eigenvalue problem. Furthermore, we have proved a priori error estimates for this new two-level stabilized method.

The model is described by the advection-diffusion boundary-value problem with a system of two differential equations. In view of the specific features of the input parameters of the problem, when the advection coefficient significantly exceeds the diffusion coefficient, the application of the classical finite-element method with linear and quadratic basis functions leads to the loss of stability of the computational process. We propose a new approach to the solution of the advection-diffusion problems with large Péclet numbers based on the replacement of the unknown function by an exponential function in the formulation of the problem and the inverse replacement prior to the application of the finite-element method. We also perform the numerical analysis of the results obtained by the application of the proposed method for the approximate solution of the problem of propagation of drugs in the wall of a vessel.",

The energy law equality at a discrete level for the GMAW system was derived by using the finite element scheme. The mass conservation and current density continuous equation with the penalty scheme was applied to improve the stability. According to the phase-field model coupled with the energy law preserving method, the GMAW model was discretized and a metal transfer process with a pulse current was simulated. It was found that the numerical solution agrees well with the data of the metal transfer process obtained by high-speed photography. Compared with the numerical solution of the volume of fluid model, which was widely studied in the GMAW system based on the finite element method Euler scheme, the energy law preserving method can provide better accuracy in predicting the shape evolution of the droplet and with a greater computing efficiency.",

This paper’s contribution is the coupling of a CFD model with a system of differential equations at the walls, governing surface and inner wall temperatures, providing an accurate computation of courtyard thermal performance. On this basis, boundary conditions for the standard Boussinesq equations governing temperatures, wind velocity, and pressure within the courtyard are established. Modelling results are compared with monitored data in two days of different months in a courtyard in Seville (Spain). Simultaneously, simulations carried out by existing software were performed. Resulting data showed more accuracy than existing tools, with a Root Mean Square Error of 1.19 (August) and 1.59 (October), while the corresponding values with ENVI-met were 3.31-3.4, and with Ladybug Tools 2.59-4.49.",

            "abstract": "A swirling wake flow submitted to an adverse pressure gradient is studied by bifurcation analysis, modal analysis and direct numerical simulations. In contrast to experiments in diverging tubes, the adverse pressure gradient is imposed by the presence of a downstream axisymmetric obstacle centred on the vortex axis. Different adverse pressure gradients are investigated by modifying the obstacle radius, which results in the deceleration of the vortex axial velocity. Hence, vortex breakdown occurs for a sufficiently large pressure gradient. We observe a spiral vortex breakdown type without any recirculation bubble, which contrasts with classical spiral vortex breakdown developing in the bubble wake. A weakly nonlinear analysis is performed to characterize this self-sustained instability. The resulting Landau equation reveals the sub-critical character of this Hopf bifurcation, highlighting a sub-critical vortex breakdown. In addition, the stabilization mechanism of this spiral vortex breakdown caused by an off-centre displacement of the downstream axisymmetric obstacle is investigated by direct numerical simulations. Nonlinear dynamics, such as a quasi-periodic state, is observed as a consequence of nonlinear interactions between the spiral vortex breakdown and the misalignment of the obstacle before the stabilization occurs.",

The geo-disciplines have a crucial role to play in the energy challenge by contributing solutions to all kind of energy resources from resource recovery to energy and waste storage. Energy geoengineering requires a broad understanding of physical processes (sediments, fractured rocks and complex multiphase fluids), coupled phenomena, constitutive models for extreme conditions, and wide-ranging spatial and time scales. Numerical methods are critical for the analysis, design, and optimal operation of energy geosystems under both short and long-term conditions. Furthermore, they allow “numerical experiments” at temporal and spatial scales that are unattainable in the laboratory. Yet, computer power can provide a false sense of reality and unjustified confidence; simulations face uncertainties related to the validation of complex multi-physics codes, limited data, excessive numbers of degrees of freedom, ill-conditioning, and uncertain model parameters. Dimensional analyses help identify the governing processes and allow for simpler and more reliable simulations. Educational programs must evolve to address the knowledge needs in energy geoscience and engineering.",

            "abstract": "The effect of surface roughness on the steady laminar flow induced by a rotating disk submerged by fluid otherwise at rest is investigated here theoretically and numerically. A theory is proposed where a triple-deck analysis is applied leading to a fast evaluation of the steady-flow modification due to the rough surface. The theory assumes that the roughness is much smaller than the boundary-layer height and is characterized by a significantly longer length scale (slender roughness). Only the leading-order correction is developed here, corresponding to a velocity-field correction that is linear with the roughness height. The proposed theory neglects some curvature terms (here partially accounted by means of a stretching of the radial coordinate and of a scaling of the dependent variables). Numerical simulations performed with different roughness geometries (axisymmetric roughness, radial grooves, and localized bumps) have been used to validate the theory. Results indicate that the proposed theory leads to a good quantification of the flow modifications due to surface roughness at a very low computational cost. A demonstration of the capabilities of the theory is finally proposed where the statistical effects on the flow due to a random (but statistically known) roughness distributed on the surface of a rotating disk are characterized.",

By constructing a Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator and introducing a transparent boundary condition, the scattering problem is reduced equivalently to a boundary value problem in a bounded domain. The discrete problem with the truncated DtN operator is solved by using the a posteriori error estimate based adaptive finite element method. The estimate takes account of both the finite element approximation error and the truncation error of the DtN operator, where the latter is shown to converge exponentially with respect to the truncation parameter. Moreover, the generalized Woodbury matrix identity is utilized to solve the resulting linear system efficiently. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.",

In this work, we demonstrate the first application of CuO nanowires as NEM switch active elements. We develop bottom-up and top-down approaches for NEM switch fabrication, such as CuO nanowire synthesis, lithography, etching, dielectrophoretic alignment of nanowires on electrodes, and nanomanipulations for building devices that are suitable for scalable production. Theoretical modelling finds the device geometry that is necessary for volatile switching. The modelling results are validated by constructing gateless double-clamped and single-clamped devices on-chip that show robust and repeatable switching. The proposed design and fabrication route enable the scalable integration of bottom-up synthesized nanowires in NEMS.",

The significance of this result is a) the finite-element method for computing approximations to solutions of the Helmholtz equation is based on the standard variational formulation, and b) the location of eigenvalues, and especially near-zero ones, plays a key role in understanding how iterative solvers such as the generalised minimum residual method (GMRES) behave when used to solve linear systems, in particular those arising from the finite-element method. The result proved in this paper is thus the first step towards rigorously understanding how GMRES behaves when applied to discretisations of high-frequency Helmholtz problems under strong trapping (the subject of the companion paper [Marchand, Galkowski, Spence, Spence, 2021]).",

To obtain a linear system for the semi-implicit schemes, we propose second-order techniques using extrapolation formulas and/or semi-implicit Taylor approximations for the temporal discretization of nonlinear terms. A numerical convergence study and a series of numerical tests are performed to analyze efficiency and robustness of the different schemes. The developed scheme, based on the proposed temporal extrapolation techniques and the mixed formulation involving the saturation and pressure head and using the standard linear Lagrange element, performs better than other schemes based on the saturation and the flux and using the Raviart-Thomas elements. The proposed semi-implicit scheme is a good alternative when implicit schemes meet convergence issues.",

Since then seismometric measurements on the Ross ice-shelf, the largest Antarctic ice-shelf, confirmed the presence of this ocean wave-induced ice-shelf vibration (Bromirski et al., 2015;Massom et al., 2018). The period of vibration ranged from the long infragravity/tsunami waves to shorter, swell waves. More recently, (Brunt et al., 2011) presented the first observational evidence that a Northern Hemisphere tsunami triggered calving on the Sulzberger ice-shelf. Mathematical models based on linear wave theory have been proposed to study these ocean-wave induced ice-shelf vibrations. The numerical method is based on finite element method and the modal expansion technique. This results in a system of equations [K-omega^(2)M+i*omega*B]{lambda}={f} whose entries are analytic functions of the incident frequency omega. The dimension of the above linear system is much smaller than the finite element degrees of freedom and can be solved efficiently. Further, using the analyticity of the resulting system, a large number of frequency domain solutions can be obtained by interpolating the linear system without having to solve the much larger finite element problem on a finer frequency grid as shown in Figure 1.

As a result, information on the membrane deformation can be inferred from voltage measurements, which opens self-sensing possibilities at high frequencies.",

More precisely, by extending standard techniques commonly used on Hilbert spaces to the case of Banach spaces, such us local estimates, suitable Helmholtz decompositions and the local approximation properties of the Clément and Raviart-Thomas operators, we derive the aforementioned a posteriori error estimator on arbitrary (convex or non-convex) polygonal and polyhedral regions. In turn, inverse inequalities, the localization technique based on bubble functions, and known results from previous works, are employed to prove the local efficiency of the proposed a posteriori error estimator. Finally, to illustrate the performance of the adaptive algorithm based on the proposed a posteriori error indicator and to corroborate the theoretical results, we provide some numerical examples.",

We consider a realistic experimental process that relies on the scan of a domain by sweeping along a tube axis a probe made out of coils, playing the role of the sources/receivers. Solving the inverse shape problem associated with these measurements using a least squares method requires solutions to the eddy-current and the adjoint problems for a large number of right-hand sides at each gradient-descent iteration. Additional cost in the forward solver comes from the use of a potential formulation of the problem that has the advantage of being independent from the topology of the conductive media (that may vary during iterations). We use a level-set approach to avoid remeshing and handle unknown topologies. The crucial ingredient in our algorithm is an optimized way of handling high numbers of right-hand sides for iterative solvers of large-scale problems. We first benchmark various block Krylov methods, block GMRES and block BGCRODR, to test their effectiveness compared to their standard counterpart, i.e., GMRES and GCRODR. Then, we propose for BGCRODR a new implementation for recycling information from previously generated Krylov bases that scales better than traditional approaches. This part is independent from the practical inverse problem at hand. The efficiency of the overall inversion procedure is finally demonstrated on realistic synthetic 3D examples.",

The goal here is to develop a multiscale patient-specific model enabling blood flow simulation from large coronary arteries to myocardial tissue. Patient vasculatures are segmented from coronary computed tomography angiography data and extended from the image-based model down to the arteriole level using a space-filling forest of synthetic trees. Blood flow is modeled by coupling a 1D model of the coronary arteries to a single-compartment Darcy myocardium model. Simulated results on five patients with non-obstructive coronary artery disease compare overall well to [15O]H2O PET exam data for both resting and hyperemic conditions. Results on a patient with severe obstructive disease link coronary artery narrowing with impaired myocardial blood flow, demonstrating the model’s ability to predict myocardial regions with perfusion deficit.

A constitutive law was previously developed to model this phenomenon; the present article deals with its implementation in a finite element (FE) program to evaluate the mechanical effects induced by the propagation of a frost front in a pavement. This novel program handles the coupling between the thermoviscoelastic problem with swelling in AC materials and the heat equation with phase change. First applied to the modelling of characterization tests on partially saturated AC specimens, the developed program has proved to be relevant. Then, to get closer to onsite conditions, an original frost-thaw test was carried out on a bilayer AC structure partially saturated. The test led to the delamination of the two layers during the second frost-thaw cycle. Its modelling showed that the interface rupture was triggered by differential strains and self-stress fields developing in the sample. These results can provide an explanation to the initialisation of the pothole issue.",

Active particles accumulate at no-flux surfaces owing to their persistent swimming, which depends on their intrinsic swim speed and reorientation time, and are subject to confinement effects when their run or persistence length is comparable to the characteristic size of the confining geometry. It has been observed in simulations that two parallel plates experience a “Casimir effect” and attract each other when placed in a dilute bath of ABPs. In this work, we provide a theoretical model based on the Smoluchowski equation and a macroscopic mechanical momentum balance to analytically predict this attractive force. We extend this method to describe the concentration partitioning of active particles between a confining channel and a reservoir, showing that the ratio of the concentration in the channel to that in the bulk increases as either run length increases or channel height decreases. The theoretical results agree well with Brownian dynamics simulations and finite element calculations.",

Two states are analyzed: a periodic state of unidirectional motion and a quasi-periodic state of slow back & forth motion around a mean horizontal position. The states emergence is explained through a fluid-solid Floquet stability analysis of the non-propulsive symmetric base solution. Unlike a purely-hydrodynamic analysis, our analysis accurately determine the locomotion states onset. An unstable synchronous mode is found when the unidirectional propulsive solution is observed. The obtained mode has a propulsive character, featuring a mean horizontal velocity and an asymmetric flow that generates a horizontal force accelerating the foil. An unstable asynchronous mode, also featuring flow asymmetry and a non-zero velocity, is found when the back & forth state is observed. Its associated complex multiplier introduces a slow modulation of the flapping period, agreeing with the quasi-periodic nature of the back & forth regime. The temporal evolution of this perturbation shows how the horizontal force exerted by the flow is alternatively propulsive or resistive over a slow period. For both modes, an analysis of the velocity and force perturbation time-averaged over the flapping period is used to establish physical instability criteria. The behaviour for large solid-to-fluid density ratio of the modes is thus analyzed. The asynchronous fluid-solid mode converges towards the purely-hydrodynamic one, whereas the synchronous mode becomes marginally unstable in our analysis not converging to the purely-hydrodynamic analysis where it is never destabilised.",

Parametric speakers must fulfill two goals: (1) high sound pressure levels of ultrasonic waves and (2) narrow directivities of ultrasonic waves. These two design goals are accomplished by two measures: (1) two close resonant frequencies and resonant mode control function and (2) an external adapter to obtain narrow directivities and high sound pressure. The first measure was achieved equipping the piezoelectric transducer with double-linked diaphragms and two radial cones. The second measure was embodied by the waveguide consisting of a sonic crystal, which was named the loop horn in this paper.

The basic idea is to extend f into a periodic function so as to use partial sums of the Fourier series as approximations. For this approach to be effective in high dimension, it proved necessary to use several ideas and concepts such as regularization, Sobol sequences and hyperbolic crosses. An attractive feature of the proposed method is that the training stage reduces to a quadratic programming problem. The presented method is first applied to some examples of high‐dimensional analytical functions, which allows some comparisons with neural networks to be made.

It is a semi-implicit algorithm in the sense that the velocity, the pressure are computed implicitly, but the domain is updated explicitly. Using one velocity field defined over the fluid-structure mesh, and globally continuous finite elements, the continuity of the velocity at the interface is automatically verified. The equation of the continuity of the stress at the interface does not appear in this formulation due to action and reaction principle. The stability in time is proved.

            "abstract": "Phase-field models are frequently adopted to simulate fracture mechanics problems in the context of the finite element method. To depict fracture, this method involves solving a coupled set of Helmholtz-like damage-field equation and augmented linear momentum balance equation. Solutions to these coupled equations are then used as descriptions of crack propagation phenomena within solids. However, this method imposes a constrain of using extremely fine meshing for properly predicting cracks. For practical problems of interest, this very often leads to linear systems with large sizes that have to be repetitively assembled and solved. As such, iterative solution procedures such as the Krylov subspace-based methods for solving these large linear systems within the framework of serial/parallel computing environments become mandatory to obtain results in a feasible time. In this work, the vectorial finite discretization for a hybrid phase-field formulation – a monolithic solving scheme – is presented. The underlying nonlinearity present in the coupled set of equations of the hybrid phase-field model is dealt through Picard iteration that helps to preserve the symmetry of the linearized system to solve. Due to the symmetric positive definite nature of the finite element linear systems obtained for this problem, the conjugate gradient method makes a standard choice of iterative solution algorithm. In this article, to improve convergence rates, consequently time to solution, of the conjugate gradient method applied to crack propagation problems, different preconditioning strategies are analyzed, tuned, and discussed. Brittle fracture benchmarks are used to measure the performance of preconditioners which are then applied to massively parallel simulations with millions of unknowns. A series of numerical experiments show that the algebraic multigrid preconditioner is well suited for solving the phase-field model for fracture, being superior to the Jacobi and the block Jacobi preconditioning in all regards: ease of solving the problem, iterations to converge, time to solution, and parallel scaling on more than a thousand processes.",

They are characterized by a quantized phase circulation of the wave function around a vortex core. Here we employ the Gross-Pitaevskii equation to investigate the structure of minimum energy vortices in cold atom Bose-Einstein condensates, in a nonrotating axially symmetric harmonic trap. For a generic value of the angular momentum along the symmetry axis, the energy minima are eccentric vortices. We find that the vortices precess around the center of the trap uniformly, in a timecrystalline fashion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when two identical vortices exchange their position, the wave function acquires a phase with an anyonic character. Our results reveal that quantum vortices have an unexpectedly rich phenomenology, suggestive of applications to emerging subjects from quantum computation to simulation and information processing.",

The typical optimization problem is to melt the desired structure, without overheating (to avoid thermally induced residual stresses) and possibly with a minimal path length. The state equation is the heat equation with a source term depending on the scanning path. First, in a steady-state context, shape optimization tools are applied to trajec-tories. Second, for time-dependent problems, an optimal control method is considered instead. In both cases, gradient type algorithms are deduced and tested on 2-d examples.

The effect of different metallic nanoparticles homogeneously suspended in the blood is considered, motivated by drug delivery (pharmacology) applications. The Eringen micropolar model has been deployed for hemorheological characteristics in the whole arterial region. The conservation equations for mass, linear momentum, angular momentum (micro-rotation), and energy and nanoparticle species are normalized by employing suitable non-dimensional variables. The transformed equations are solved numerically subject to physically appropriate boundary conditions using the finite element method with the variational formulation scheme available in the FreeFEM++ code. A good correlation is achieved between the FreeFEM++ computations and existing results. The effect of selected parameters (taper angle, Prandtl number, Womersley parameter, pulsatile constants, and volumetric concentration) on velocity, temperature, and microrotational (Eringen angular) velocity has been calculated for a stenosed arterial segment. Wall shear stress, volumetric flow rate, and hemodynamic impedance of blood flow are also computed. Colour contours and graphs are employed to visualize the simulated blood flow characteristics. It is observed that by increasing Prandtl number (Pr), the micro-rotational velocity decreases i.e., microelement (blood cell) spin is suppressed. Wall shear stress decreases with the increment in pulsatile parameters (B and e), whereas linear velocity increases with a decrement in these parameters. Furthermore, the velocity decreases in the tapered region with elevation in the Womersley parameter (α).

Firstly, let us think about a problem seeking the appropriate arrangement of holes in a domain where the boundary value problem of a partial differential equation is defined. Such a problem is known as the topology optimization problem. Here, the term topology refers to the study of geometrical properties and spatial relation of objects unaffected by the continuous change of their shape or size. In mathematics, two mathematical objects are said to belong to the same topology if they are images of two homotopic maps; that is, if one can be continuously deformed into the other. Therefore, letting n be a natural number, a set of n-connected domains are regarded as belonging to the same homotopy groups. Here, the term “topology optimization” in the topology optimization problem refers to the determination of the connectivity of the design domain that optimizes an object’s material distribution through insertion and arrangement of holes in its structure. However, as will be explained in detail later, the shape of the holes actually becomes the target. Therefore, the problems dealt with in this chapter also become included in shape optimization problems in a wider sense. In this book, it will be referred to as the topology optimization problem in the sense that topology is also in the scope of the design.",

The system obtained consists of four diffusion-convection-reaction equations for which we show the existence and uniqueness of a global solution. The system is approximated by a standard finite element method that satisfies an optimal a priori error estimate. We compare the results obtained for three forms of the growth function: single substrate limiting, 'multiplicative' form, and 'minimum' form. We highlight the limitation of the 'single substrate limiting model', where the dependency of the bacterial growth on the nitrate is neglected, and find that the 'minimum' model gives numerical results closer to the experimental results.",

To further demonstrate the robustness of the proposed schemes, the effects of injected charges for Rayleigh-Taylor instability and the electro-convection phenomenon between two concentric half-cylinders are simulated.

Furthermore, there exists a critical surface anchoring strength for non-spherical bacteria-like microswimmers, such that swimming occurs perpendicular in a sub-critical case and parallel in super-critical case. Finally, we demonstrate that for large propulsion speeds active microswimmers generate topological defects in the bulk of the liquid crystal.

In this study, by performing large-scale numerical experiments, we analyze the conduction–radiation coupling characteristics within different (with respect to topology and porosity) silicon carbide (SiC)-based open-cell cellular ceramics surrounded by fictitious vacuum up to temperatures of 1800 K. To induct minimal approximations, our finite element simulations are based on a discrete-scale approach within which realistic discrete (pore-level) representations of the cellular ceramics are used as numerical media. The results presented in this study provide means to better understand the role of radiation in the coupled conduction–radiation physics within the ceramic samples. A detailed comparison on effectiveness of energy conversion is established for SiC-based full-scale cubic-cell, Kelvin-cell, and pseudo-random-cell ceramic structures which are at 80% and 90% porosity each. In conclusion, among the different standalone and full-scale ceramic samples, the Kelvin-cell structures at 90% porosity have proven to benefit the most from radiation coupling.",

Specifically, in ophthalmology, one of the popular non–invasive means of ocular tissue imaging is the Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). In this thesis we deal with the modelling of the corneal tissue whose opacity is subject of interest among scientists still today. Our goal is to generate a virtual OCT scan using an appropriate mathematical model which could further locate conditions that lead to clouding of the human cornea. Since eye’s structures, in physical sense, represent anisotropic materials, the model requires the study of such materials. Although the numerical analysis, present in the literature, is restricted to isotropic materials, we well modify the computational tool to the anisotropic case. Comprehension of optical eye’s properties is certainly necessary to establish a mathematical model. For the purpose of numerical simulations and analysis of the numerical algorithm, different types of boundary conditions encountered in electromagnetism are considered. Numerical simulations are performed by applying so–called Runge–Kutta discontinuous Galerkin method on Maxwell’s equations previously adapted to the model. A detailed analysis of obtained results is presented. A large part of thesis is occupied by the proposition of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, a procedure that belongs to the family of finite element methods. The DG method is applied on spatial discretization, while an explicit Runge–Kutta method is employed for temporal integration. In this way we get a full discretization of initial equations. In addition, convergence and stability of these methods are well studied and numerically tested on various schemes defined on different meshes.",

Our method relies on a formulation inspired by the work of Fursikov and Imanuvilov. More precisely, we minimize over the class of admissible null controls a functional that involves weighted integrals of the state and the control, with weights that blow up at the final time. The use of the weights is crucial to ensure the existence of the controls and the associated state in a reasonable space.

Membrane dynamics are completely specified by two dimensionless numbers: the well-known Föppl–von Kármán number Γ and the recently introduced Scriven–Love number SL, respectively quantifying the base tension and base flow speed. For unstable tubes, the growth rate of a local perturbation depends only on Γ, whereas SL governs the absolute or convective nature of the instability. Furthermore, nonlinear simulations of unstable tubes reveal an initially localized disturbance results in propagating fronts, which leave a thin atrophied tube in their wake. Depending on the value of Γ, the thin tube is connected to the unperturbed regions via oscillatory or monotonic shape transitions— reminiscent of recent experimental observations on the retraction and atrophy of axons. We elucidate our findings through a weakly nonlinear analysis, which shows membrane dynamics may be approximated by a model of the class of extended Fisher–Kolmogorov equations. This model possesses Lifshitz points, where the front dynamics undergo a steady-to-oscillatory bifurcation, thus shedding light on the pattern selection mechanism in neurons.",

The procedure is based on the coupling of geometric shape optimization with topology optimization. We start from a full-mass body corresponding to a given material occupying entirely the initial design domain. The first phase of geometric shape optimization acts as an out-of-the-box paradigm. It allows one to modify the initial design domain by acting only on its boundary, keeping the same volume and topology. With respect to the full-mass body, this phase reduces the compliance to a large extent. The successive step of topology optimization does actually change the topology of the structure, e.g., by introducing holes, reduces the volume according to the volume constraint, but does not affect the boundary of the structure, which is fixed by the previous phase. Overall, the combined approach allows us to design a new structure, that is lighter and stiffer with respect to the full-mass body. Additionally, the employment of a structure-tailored computational mesh, via an anisotropic mesh adaptation procedure during topology optimization, yields an intrinsically smooth final layout characterized by free-form features. An extensive numerical assessment corroborates both qualitatively and quantitatively the performances of the proposed optimization algorithm.",

            "abstract": "We present a numerical method for the solution of linear magnetostatic problems in domains with a symmetry direction, including axial and translational symmetry. The approach uses a Fourier series decomposition of the vector potential formulation along the symmetry direction and covers both, zeroth (non-oscillatory) and non-zero (oscillatory) harmonics. For the latter it is possible to eliminate one component of the vector potential resulting in a fully transverse vector potential orthogonal to the transverse magnetic field. In addition to the Poisson-like equation for the longitudinal component of the non-oscillatory problem, a general curl-curl Helmholtz equation results for the transverse problem covering both, non-oscillatory and oscillatory case. The derivation is performed in the covariant formalism for curvilinear coordinates with a tensorial permeability and symmetry restrictions on metric and permeability tensor. The resulting variational forms are treated by the usual nodal finite element method for the longitudinal problem and by a two-dimensional edge element method for the transverse problem. The numerical solution can be computed independently for each harmonic which is favourable with regard to memory usage and parallelisation.",

The provided analysis shows the method converges exponentially with respect to the ratio between the two largest eigenvalues, which is also approximated during the process. An augmented technique is also introduced, and is shown to stabilize the early stages of the iteration. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the theory and demonstrate the methods.",

The considered physical situations involve a weak coupling between the Navier–Stokes equations for the velocity and the pressure in the fluid, and the convection–diffusion equation for the temperature field. The proposed framework combines several recent techniques from the field of shape and topology optimization, and notably a level-set based mesh evolution algorithm for tracking shapes and their defor- mations, an efficient optimization algorithm for constrained shape optimization problems, and a numerical method to handle a wide variety of geometric constraints such as thickness constraints and non-penetration constraints. Our strategy is applied to the optimization of various types of heat exchangers. At first, we consider a simplified 2D cross-flow model where the optimized boundary is the section of the hot fluid phase flowing in the transverse direction, which is naturally composed of multiple holes. A minimum thickness constraint is imposed on the cross-section so as to account for manufacturing and maximum pressure drop constraints. In a second part, we optimize the design of 2D and 3D heat exchangers composed of two types of fluid channels (hot and cold), which are separated by a solid body. A non-mixing constraint between the fluid components containing the hot and cold phases is enforced by prescribing a minimum distance between them. Numerical results are presented on a variety of test cases, demonstrating the efficiency of our approach in generating new, realistic, and unconventional heat exchanger designs.",

            "abstract": "It is known that spurious non-physical velocities can occur when one employs the finite element method for simulation of incompressible flows subjected to external forces. In presence of external body forces, the main reason for this is the incompressibility constraint that is satisfied only in a weak sense against test functions from the pressure function space. In case of the two-phase (incompressible) immiscible flow, a surface force, which is a function of the interface curvature, arises and introduces additional problematics to the finite element model. Due to discrete representation of the interface, the question arises on how to approximate the curvature. A particularly natural approach for the finite element method employs the Laplace–Beltrami operator which allows to express the mean curvature in a weak sense. However, once incorporated into the equations governing the fluid flow, Laplace–Beltrami-reconstructed curvature may introduce spurious non-physical forces at the interface if finite element spaces are chosen arbitrarily. The reason for this is that the test space used for curvature calculation is the test space associated with the velocity field. We show that it is necessary for the function space used for the geometry construction to be of the order equal to or higher than the order of the test space involved in curvature evaluation. This leaves two possibilities for practical fluid flow problems: use the same function spaces for the mesh geometry and the velocity field (isoparametric concept) or decouple the curvature calculation from the main problem.",

However, LPBF is known to cause residual stress and distortion during fabrication, which adversely affects the mechanical properties and dimensional accuracy of the part. Therefore, predicting and avoiding the residual stress and distortion are critical issues. Our goal is to propose a topology optimization method that considers distortion in AM and an analytical model of AM suitable for incorporation into topology optimization. First, we propose an analytical model of the AM building process by LPBF, and formulate an optimization problem. Next, a topological derivative of the objective functional is approximately derived using an adjoint variable method and is utilized to update the level set function via a time evolutionary reaction-diffusion equation. Finally, two-dimensional design examples demonstrate the validations and effectiveness of the proposed optimization methodology.",

We investigate quantitatively the surface localization of the plasmons in three dimensions. The results are threefold. We first prove that on smooth bounded domains of general shape the sequence of plasmons converges to zero off the boundary surface almost surely at the rate of j−1/2. We then prove that if the domain is strictly convex, then the convergence rate becomes j−∞, namely, it is faster than j−N for any integer N. As a consequence, we prove that cloaking by anomalous localized resonance does not occur on three-dimensional strictly convex smooth domains. We then look into the surface localization of the plasmons on the Clifford torus by numerical computations. The Clifford torus is taken as an example of non-convex surfaces. The computational results show that the torus exhibits the spectral property completely different from strictly convex domains. In particular, they suggest that there is a subsequence of plasmons on the torus which has much slower decay than other entries of the sequence.",

The numerical simulation of fracture networks of realistic size requires the efficient parallel solution of large coupled non-linear systems.

Here, we present Utopia, which is an open-source C++ library for parallel non-linear multilevel solution strategies. Utopia provides the advantages of high-level programming interfaces while at the same time a framework to access low-level data-structures without breaking code encapsulation. Complex numerical procedures can be expressed with few lines of code, and evaluated by different implementations, libraries, or computing hardware. In this paper, we investigate the parallel performance of our implementation of the recursive multilevel trust-region (RMTR) method based on the Utopia library. RMTR is a globally convergent multilevel solution strategy designed to solve non-convex constrained minimization problems. In particular, we solve pressure-induced phase-field fracture propagation in large and complex fracture networks. Solving such problems is deemed challenging even for a few fractures, however, here we are considering networks of realistic size with up to 1000 fractures.",

The single domain approach used in our previous contribution [A. Rakotondrandisa, G. Sadaka, I.

As a result, the computational time is considerably reduced for 2D configurations and furthermore 3D problems become affordable. The numerical method is based on an enthalpy-porosity model. The same set of equations is solved in both liquid and solid phases: the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with Boussinesq approximation for thermal effects. A Carman-Kozeny-type penalty term is added to the momentum equations to bring progressively the velocity to zero into the solid. Model equations are discretized using Galerkin triangular or tetrahedral finite elements. The coupled system of equations is integrated in time using a second-order Gear implicit scheme. The resulting discrete equations are solved using a Newton algorithm. The DDM approach is based on an overlapping Schwarz method. The mesh is first split in subdomains using Scotch or Metis libraries. The final linear system is then solved in parallel using a GMRES Krylov method, with a Restricted Additive Schwarz (RAS) preconditioner. The mesh is adapted during the computation using metrics control. The 3D-mesh adaptivity uses the mmg (www.mmgtools.org) open source library. Parallel 2D and 3D computations of benchmark cases of increasing difficulty are presented: natural convection of air, natural convection of water, melting or solidification of a phase-change material, and, finally, a water freezing case. For each case, careful validations are provided and the performance of the code is assessed.

Due to the sign-changing coefficients in the equations, it is not straightforward to obtain uniform energy estimates to apply the usual homogenization techniques. The goal of this article is to explain how to proceed in this context. The analysis of Maxwell's equations is based on a precise study of two associated scalar problems: one involving the sign-changing permittivity with Dirichlet boundary conditions, another involving the sign-changing permeability with Neumann boundary conditions. For both problems, we obtain a criterion on the physical parameters ensuring uniform invertibility of the corresponding operators as the size of the inclusions tends to zero. In the process, we explain the link existing with the so-called Neumann-Poincaré operator, complementing the existing literature on this topic. Then we use the results obtained for the scalar problems to derive uniform energy estimates for Maxwell's system. At this stage, an additional difficulty comes from the fact that Maxwell's equations are also sign-indefinite due to the term involving the frequency. To cope with it, we establish some sort of uniform compactness result.",

The method is based on the London equation j=−ρsA, where j is the current density and A is the vector potential. Using a rotor free A and a measurement of j via the magnetic moment of a superconducting ring, we determine ρs. By increasing A until the London equation fails we determine jc and ξ. The method is sensitive to very small stiffness, which translates to penetration depth λ≲1 mm. It is also sensitive to low critical current density jc∼103Amm−2 or long coherence length ξ∼1μm. Naturally the method does not suffer from demagnetization factor complications, the presence of vortices, or out-of-equilibrium conditions. Therefore, the absolute values of the different parameters can be determined. We demonstrate the application of this method to La2−xSrxCuO4 with x=0.17.",

Using this characterization, we analyze the dependence of the spreading speed on various parameters, including diffusion rates and the size and shape of the section of the domain. In particular, we provide new theoretical results on several asymptotic regimes like small and high diffusion rates and sections with small and large sizes. These results generalize earlier ones which were available in the radial homogeneous case. Finally, we numerically investigate the issue of shape optimization of the spreading speed. By computing its shape derivative, we observe, in the case of homogeneous coefficients, that a disk either maximizes or minimizes the speed, depending on the parameters of the problem, both with or without constraints. We also show the results of numerical shape optimization with non homogeneous coefficients, when the disk is no longer an optimizer.",

The state equation is the heat equation with a source term depending on the scanning path. First, in a steady-state context, shape optimization tools are applied to trajectories.

First, we use a 2D non Newtonian flow model, and later a weakly coupled FSI model to make a preliminary study of the main features of flow over a stenotic coronary arterial portion. We then introduce a methodology to estimate the virtual FFR in analogy with the clinical device. The FFR device was considered non-physical (integrated to the flow domain) at a first place. We led different experiments to enumerate the factors affecting the virtual FFR and computed its profiles with respect to different lesion’s parameters. Second, we consider two realistic geometries: a 2D left coronary tree obtained from the segmentation of an angiography image and a 3D bifurcation tree. We define generalized flow models inside the two geometries and consider the arterial wall to be rigid. The presence of several outlets in these new geometries led us to define a new type of boundary conditions. For the inlet, we propose a bi-sinusoidal function approaching the velocity profile recorded inside a left coronary tree. For the outlets, we implement a 2 elementWindkessel model. We led a comparative study between Navier Stokes and the flow model considered and between free outlets boundary conditions and Windkessel model in 2D and define the flow inside the 3D bifurcation tree. We also compute the virtual FFR of two artificial lesions added to the coronary tree and demonstrate that angiography alone is not enough to evaluate the severity of stenosis. Third, we investigate - through 2D and 3D modelling - one possible reason of pressure drift during FFR measurement, that is the arbitrary position and configuration of the FFR device, considered during this study extrinsic to the flow domain. We consider the same non Newtonian flow models as previously. In 2D, the FFR device is assimilated to a disk with a variable position incorporated inside the left coronary tree. While the 3D domain corresponds to a diseased arterial portion to which we introduce a deformed 3D tube (wire+sensor) with a given length and coefficient of bending. The bending effect of the tube is obtained thanks to an elastic problem based on Hooke’s law. Using a Gaussian process, we model the FFR depending on these variables - and two additional stenosis variables later - we perform a set of samples corresponding to the design space considered. The 2D data indicates a good accuracy for FFR prediction while the 4D data emphasis the fact that mi- crocatheters with important diameters overestimate lesion’s severity. The results obtained demonstrate that drift occurring because of the variable device configuration may lead to stenosis misclassification. All resolution algorithms and simulation tools were implemented under FreeFem++ software. The need of more space memory for 3D simulations led us to adopt a parallel resolution strategy using FreeFem++ MPI and MUMPS solver.",

When launched on a satellite, these detectors are subjected to ionizing radiation from cosmic rays or solar flares (mainly protons) which degrade the detector performance. Indeed, an elevation of the detector background was noted under irradiation, which is believed to be associated with the luminescence of the CZT substrate. Complete removal of the substrate eliminates the problem, but it is a challenging step in the fabrication process. A deeper understanding of the response of IR detectors under irradiation, when the substrate is fully removed, will enable the optimization of substrate design for high-performance space-based scientific imaging. Here, the first results of proton irradiation modeling in MCT detectors, including energy deposition in the CZT substrate, are presented. The estimation of image pollution relies on GEANT4 (GEometry ANd Tracking 4) Monte Carlo simulations as well as analytical and numerical calculations of carrier transport inside the detector structure. In particular, recombination processes in the CZT substrate are taken into account to model the luminescence effect induced by proton irradiation. According to this model, considering published material properties, the diffusion of the carriers generated inside the CZT substrate toward the MCT layer is the main source of pollution. As the substrate thickness increases, more pixels are impacted by a proton impact on the IR. Consequently, depending on the targeted application, either partial or complete removal may be chosen.",

We show here that this result is also true for the iterative version of the method at the continuous level for strip-wise decompositions into subdomains that can typically be encountered when solving wave-guide problems. The convergence proof relies on the particular block Toeplitz structure of the global iteration matrix. Although non-Hermitian, we prove that its limiting spectrum has a near identical form to that of a Hermitian matrix of the same structure. We illustrate our results with numerical experiments.",

These computations hold a crucial role in the design cycle meant to optimize their participating behavior at high temperatures.

For the accurate resolution of multi-scale thermal radiative transport, very little is known today about the role of these truncated textural information to the overall effective radiative properties. With the ultimate prospect of large scale finite element modeling of electromagnetic scattering for participating media, this initial attempt in 2D explores this aspect, learning from the ability of fractals to quantify textural details or roughness of complex objects. Based on a desirable error tolerance, critical quantitative limits were drawn, with which future large scale electromagnetic scattering computations can be performed confidently with optimum resources, without compromising the accuracy. From intensive numerical experiments, ample textural details relevant for a desired accuracy (1% error) of the extinction efficiency, scattering efficiency, and asymmetry parameter are quantified, and limits established. Error estimates for the aforementioned radiative properties at the limiting resolution (1 µm) of the economical imaging techniques today, are also drawn for better insights.",

By decreasing the plate’s stiffness, four regimes of flow-induced vibrations are identified: two regimes of periodic oscillation about a symmetric position, separated by a regime of periodic oscillation about asymmetric positions, and finally a regime of quasi-periodic oscillation occurring at very low stiffness and characterized by two fundamental (high and low) frequencies. A linear fully coupled fluid–solid analysis is then performed and reveals the destabilization of a steady symmetry-breaking mode, two high-frequency unsteady modes and one low-frequency unsteady mode, when varying the plate’s stiffness. These unstable eigenmodes explain the emergence of the nonlinear self-sustained oscillating states and provide a good prediction of the oscillation frequencies. A comparison with nonlinear calculations is provided to show the limits of the linear approach. Finally, two simplified analyses, based on the quiescent-fluid or quasi-static assumption, are proposed to further identify the linear mechanisms at play in the destabilization of the fully coupled modes. The quasi-static static analysis allows an understanding of the behaviour of the symmetry-breaking and low-frequency modes. The quiescent-fluid stability analysis provides a good prediction of the high-frequency vibrations, unlike the bending modes of the splitter plate in vacuum, as a result of the fluid added-mass correction. The emergence of the high-frequency periodic oscillations can thus be predicted based on a resonance condition between the frequencies of the hydrodynamic vortex-shedding mode and of the quiescent-fluid solid modes.",

For both cases we construct approximations to the velocity and the pressure. For the first case, we analyze a method in which the snapshots are based on a stabilized scheme with equal order polynomials for the velocity and the pressure with Local Projection Stabilization (LPS) for the gradient of the velocity and the pressure. For the POD method we add the same kind of LPS stabilization for the gradient of the velocity and the pressure than the direct method, together with grad-div stabilization. In the second case, the snapshots are based on an inf-sup stable Galerkin method with grad-div stabilization and for the POD model we apply also grad-div stabilization. In this case, since the snapshots are discretely divergence-free, the pressure can be removed from the formulation of the POD approximation to the velocity. To approximate the pressure, needed in many engineering applications, we use a supremizer pressure recovery method. Error bounds with constants independent on inverse powers of the viscosity parameter are proved for both methods. Numerical experiments show the accuracy and performance of the schemes.",

For both problems, the a priori regularity of the solution and the solution's curl is analysed. The regularity results are obtained by splitting the fields and using shift theorems for second-order divergence elliptic operators. Finally, the discretization of the formulations with a H(curl)-conforming approximation based on edge finite elements is considered.

The nonlinear coarse mesh system incorporates an artificial viscosity term into the Navier–Stokes system as a stabilizing factor, making the nonlinear system easier to resolve.

Such an sources are called the 'follower control' and its associated 'disturbance signal'. This procedure corresponds to a robust control problem. The second one is a hierarchic control problem (Stackelberg strategy), which involves the third force, so-called leader control. The RSC problem establishes a simultaneous game for these forces in the sense that, the leader control has as objective to verify a controllability property, while the follower control and perturbation solve a robust control problem. In this paper the leader control obeys to the exact controllability to the trajectories.

The linear terms of the governing equations are reduced by Galerkin projection onto a POD basis of the flow state, while the reduced nonlinear convection terms are obtained either by a Galerkin projection onto the same state basis, by a Galerkin projection onto a POD basis representing the nonlinearities or by applying the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM) to a POD basis of the nonlinearities. The quality of the reduced order models is assessed as to their stability, accuracy and robustness, and appropriate quantitative measures are introduced and compared. In particular, the properties of the reduced linear terms are compared to those of the full-scale terms, and the structure of the nonlinear quadratic terms is analyzed as to the conservation of kinetic energy. It is shown that all three reduction techniques provide excellent and similar results for the cases of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and the limit-cycle cylinder flow.

The solution obtained in an actual computation is typically one out of several local minimizers. Evidence of multiple solutions induced by small perturbations of numerical or physical parameters was occasionally recorded but not explicitly investigated in the literature. In this work, we focus on this issue and advocate a paradigm shift, away from the search for one particular solution towards the simultaneous description of all possible solutions (local minimizers), along with the probabilities of their occurrence. Inspired by recent approaches advocating measure-valued solutions (Young measures as well as their generalization to statistical solutions) and their numerical approximations in fluid mechanics, we propose the stochastic relaxation of the variational brittle fracture problem through random perturbations of the functional. We introduce the concept of stochastic solution, with the main advantage that point-to-point correlations of the crack phase fields in the underlying domain can be captured. These stochastic solutions are represented by random fields or random variables with values in the classical deterministic solution spaces. In the numerical experiments, we use a simple Monte Carlo approach to compute approximations to such stochastic solutions. The final result of the computation is not a single crack pattern, but rather several possible crack patterns and their probabilities. The stochastic solution framework using evolving random fields allows additionally the interesting possibility of conditioning the probabilities of further crack paths on intermediate crack patterns.",

The proposed configuration allows a wide range of coupling coefficients from 2.5 to 61 dB with low losses and reduced dispersion. Based on finite element method (FEM) analysis and by solving the Laplace equation in two dimensions (2D), the study of the proposed coupler is realized under FreeFEM environment. In order to validate our numerical results, we have adapted our FEM-program to characterize the structure of interest for the homogenous case. Our FEM-results are very close with those obtained by other methods of the scientific literature. In a quasi-TEM approximation of the present work , we focus mainly on determining the even-and odd-mode characteristic impedances (Z 0e , Z 0o), the even-and odd-mode effective dielectric constants (ε 0eff , ε 0odd), coupling coefficient (k), and the primary inductive and capacitive matrices ([L], [C]). The effects of cut depth (u) and dielectric radius to the inner-conductor radius (w/r c) ratios on the EM-parameters have been taken into account. When the quasi-TEM parameters were determined, we have applied curve-fitting techniques under origin50 graph environment to find new simple, concise formulas for all the EM-parameters of the quasi-TEM sliced coaxial coupler. The difference between the calculated numerical values using our CAD program based on the FEM and the derived equations is less than 2% over a wide range of design parameters.

The numerical discretization is tackled by first approximating the fracture through a phase field, following an Ambrosio-Tortorelli like approach, and then resorting to an alternating minimization procedure, where the irreversibility of the crack propagation is rigorously imposed via an inequality constraint. The minimization is enriched with an anisotropic mesh adaptation driven by an a posteriori error estimator, which allows us to sharply track the whole crack path by optimizing the shape, the size, and the orientation of the mesh elements.

            "abstract": "In vehicle tire/road contact modeling, dynamic models are typically used which incorporate the vehicle’s suspension in their estimation: thus relying on a known stiffness to determine the movement of the wheel in response to roughness excitation. For the case of a wheeled device rolling on a floor (such as a delivery trolley moving merchandise around inside a commercial building), there is often no suspension, yet the wheel is still too soft to able to be considered mechanically rigid (as is the case in train/rail contact). A model which is aimed at incorporating the dynamic effects of the trolley in predicting the sound generated by rolling needs to provide a robust way of estimating the wheel’s effective stiffness. This work presents an original technique for estimating the stiffness of a solid cylindrical wheel. A parametric study was conducted in order to identify the dependence of the wheel stiffness on each of the relevant variables: including the wheel’s radius, axle size, width, applied load, and material properties. The methodology may be used to estimate the stiffness of new wheel types (i.e. different geometries and materials) without needing to solve a finite element model each time. Such a methodology has application beyond the field of acoustics, as the characterization of shapes with non-constant cross sections may be useful in the wider field of materials science.",

At the same time, we strive for ease of implementation of the developed methods in computer algebra systems (Maple, Sage) or in software oriented to the finite element method (FreeFem++). The work uses the representation of electromagnetic fields in a waveguide using four potentials. These potentials do not reduce the number of sought functions, but even in the case when the dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability are described by discontinuous functions, they turn out to be quite smooth functions. A simple check of the operability of programs by calculating the normal modes of a hollow waveguide is made. It is shown that the relative error in the calculation of the first 10 normal modes does not exceed 4%. These results indicate the efficiency of the method proposed in this article.",

This is particularly interesting for the amorphous materials such as epoxy resins because their micro/meso structures are difficult to characterize so that any information connecting different scales would be extremely useful. At the process level the polymerization rate, which influences considerably the performance of materials, can be changed experimentally. However, it is known that the maximum toughness does not always appear at the maximum polymerization rate, which suggests that some differences in the micro/meso-scopic structure affect the macroscopic property behind. The goal of this article is to present a framework to bridge between a mesoscopic observation of X-ray CT images and the macroscopic criterion of fracture toughness computed via phase field modeling. First we map the X-ray images with different polymerization rates into several categories using different methods: one is singular value decomposition (SVD) and the other is persistent homology. Secondly we compute a crack propagation of each sample and evaluate a scalar value called the effective toughness (ET) via J-integral, which is one of the good candidates indicating a toughness of materials. It turns out that ET reflects the performance of each sample and consistent with the experimental results.",

When inflated over a cavity, the membrane radiates sound and can therefore be used as a loudspeaker. This type of device has been studied both experimentally and numerically. However, most studies on the dynamics of dielectric elastomer membranes either focus on the very low frequency behavior to analyse viscosity effects for example, or try to maximise the overall radiated sound pressure level. Here the mid-frequency range is analysed in detail, by setting up a fully coupled finite element model of an inflated dielectric elastomer membrane. Electrostatics, vibro-acoustics, free-field radiation, and pre-stressed linear dynamics are solved together, to find the fluid loaded resonance modes. The dynamics of the membrane and the sound radiation are then computed using this resonance mode basis. Perfectly matched layers are used to implement the Sommerfeld radiation boundary condition. The model is validated by a comparison with measurements of the pressure radiated by a prototype, and predicts accurately the radiated pressure and the directivity. This model should therefore help the development of optimized dielectric elastomer loudspeakers, with improved frequency responses and directivity.",

            "abstract": "Two-dimensional steady-state solutions of liquid metal mixed convection in a horizontal bottom-heating duct under a strong magnetic field are first computed numerically by the Newton iteration method along with the spatial discretization of the Taylor–Hood finite element. Two branches of steady solutions with symmetrical rolls and a pair of asymmetrical solutions with a single roll are identified and can be regarded as the base flow for linear global stability analysis. The symmetrical steady solution for the first branch has a nearly uniform distribution for the temperature field in the transverse direction, while the second branch occurs at much larger Grashof numbers and the temperature field becomes nonuniform transversely. The linear stability analysis is performed for a fixed Reynolds number and Prandtl number with Re = 5000 and Pr = 0.0321. For the symmetrical rolls of the first branch, with an increase in the Grashof number, two-dimensional stationary instabilities first occur at small Hartmann numbers, while three-dimensional oscillatory instabilities first appear at moderate or large Hartmann numbers. From the further study of the two-dimensional instabilities, it is revealed that the asymmetrical solution is actually bifurcated supercritically from the symmetrical solution at a two-dimensional critical Grashof number. In addition, the critical curve of the Grashof number with respect to the Hartmann number for the three-dimensional oscillatory mode shows that there exists a minimum critical Grashof number, which occurs at a moderate Hartmann number. The critical curves of the one-roll asymmetrical solution are also exhibited and determined by two three-dimensional oscillatory unstable modes. It is revealed that there exists a minimum Hartmann number below which the asymmetrical steady-state can always remain stable for all Grashof numbers (5 × 105–107). The energy analyses at the oscillatory critical thresholds with different Hartmann numbers are performed to exhibit that buoyancy is the dominant destabilizing term, and the magnetic force is always the main stabilization term for both symmetrical and asymmetrical solutions. In addition, both streamwise and cross-sectional shears of the basic flow are important for the determination of the linear stability boundary of the asymmetrical solution.",

We focus on the inclusion of the singular short range interaction effects (lubrication effects) in the simulations when the particles come close one to another. The problem is solved without introducing new hypothesis nor model. As in [Lefebvre-Lepot, Merlet, Nguyen, JFM, 2015], the key idea is to decompose the velocity and pressure flows in a sum of a singular and a regular part. In this article, the singular part is computed using an explicit asymptotic expansion of the solution when the distance goes to zero. This expansion is similar to the asymptotic expansion proposed in [Hillairet, Kelai, Asymptotic Analysis, 2015] but is more appropriate for numerical simulations of suspensions. It can be computed for any shape of particles. Using [Hillairet, Kelai, Asymptotic Analysis, 2015] as an intermediate result, we prove that the remaining part is regular in the sense that it is bounded independently of the distance. As a consequence, only a small number of degrees of freedom are necessary to obtain accurate results. The method is tested in dimension 2 for clusters of two or three aligned particles with general rigid velocities. We show that, as expected, the convergence is independent on the distance.",

The electrical brain activity is a complex process of electrical propagation because the brain structure is an incredibly complex structure. This complex structure leads to different conductivity property in term of its magnitude and orientation, called anisotropic conductivity. Using Maxwell’s equations, the electrical brain activity has been studied intensively. For simplification, the quasistatic Maxwell’s equations are used to model the electrical brain activity and it leads to deal with a Poisson’s equation. In this research, a feasibility study of using Operator Splitting Method (OSM) to solve anisotropic 2-Dimensional (2D) Poisson’s equation is performed. A freeware of finite element method (FEM) is employed to build matrices used in the OSM algorithm. The OSM algorithm which is written in Matlab is then tested to solve anisotropic 2D Laplace’s equation and anisotropic Poisson’s equation with dipolar source. Some numerical experiments have been performed to test the performance of the OSM algorithm. The OSM solution of anisotropic 2D Laplace’s equation coincide with the exact and direct numerical solution of the problem. For anisotropic 2D Poisson’s equation with dipolar source, some similar results has been obtained too. The pattern of the OSM solutions are similar to the pattern of direct numerical solutions of the problem. The results arise a hope to attempt implementing the OSM algorithm for more complex problem such as a realistic human head model.",

At the same time, in the academic world, it is frequent to develop in-house simulation software, even from scratch and without proper knowledge of the existing possibilities. The rationale of the present paper is to review, from a practical viewpoint, the open-source software that can be useful in the antenna design process. To this end, an introductory overview of the usual design workflow is firstly presented. Subsequently, the strengths and weaknesses of open-source software compared to its commercial counterpart are analyzed. After that, the main open-source packages that are currently available online are briefly described. The last part of this paper is devoted to a preliminary numerical benchmark for the assessment of the capabilities and limitations of a subset of the presented open-source programs. The benchmark includes the calculation of some fundamental antenna parameters for four different typologies of radiating elements.",

The current review aims at specifying a complementary view with respect to other revisions in the field by illustrating some selected studies that may constitute a first step in the connection between cerebral and ocular fluid dynamics. First we present lumped-parameter models with a simplified mathematical structure that allow fast computations of the average values of the unknowns and capture the main behavior of the cerebral flow. The discussion then moves onto distributed models, which produce a three-dimensional representation of cerebrospinal fluid flows in complex geometries that may derive from medical imaging. These models allow the investigation of the fluid flow at fine scales, constituting a highly valuable tool in providing a better understanding of pathophysiology. We acknowledge that significant efforts have already been made in the attempt to unify mathematics and medicine in the context of brain diseases caused by cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities; nevertheless, we report a pressing demand for innovative mathematical models that may achieve the complete description and simulation of the biophysical connections between the eye and the brain.",

It is shown that the spatio-temporal growth noise has two opposing effect: the temporal noise promotes the reproducibility of the organ shape, whereas the spatial noise disturbs it, leading to the organ undergoing an abnormal shape deformation. To understand how such abnormality can emerge, we study the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix of the growth velocity. It is revealed that the anomalous shape deformations can be created by two independent factors: (1) excited modes where the orientations of the eigenvectors with m ≥ 2 are spatially correlated, and/or (2) soft spots where spot structures with high fluctuations in the magnitudes of the eigenvectors appear non-uniformly.",

            "abstract": "The issue of power exhaust in fusion reactors is currently considered as one of the potential show-stoppers on the pathway towards the realization of fusion energy. As the power of fusion devices increases (from current experiments to the foreseen demonstrator reactor DEMO), also the specific load on the divertor -the component which is responsible for exhausting the power- increases. Under such conditions, the currently envisaged baseline divertor design -based on actively cooled tungsten monoblocks- would have a lifetime of less than two operation years, forcing the fusion power plant to be shut down for maintenance for a relatively long time. For nuclear fusion electricity to be competitive, this would be unacceptable. One of the alternatives to this baseline strategy is to employ a liquid metal (LM) divertor. The working principle consists in keeping in place a thin film of liquid metal in the region where the plasma ions and electrons imping, i.e. the divertor targets. Exposing a liquid surface to the plasma would avoid issues associated with melting. Moreover, concerns about thermomechanical stresses could be relaxed. The issues of power handling and of neutron compatibility could be decoupled (the plasma-facing surface would be the molten metal, whereas the substrate on which the LM film is placed could be designed optimizing the compatibility with the high neutron fluences foreseen in the reactor). Moreover, both the LM evaporation and the interactions of the evaporated metal with the near-divertor plasma could reduce the heat to be exhausted by the component. Among the difficulties associated with the implementation of an LM divertor, we can cite issues associated with the LM surface and with the plasma response to the presence of the divertor. From the point of view of the surface, confining an LM film in an environment with extremely large magnetic fields is a challenge. It is also necessary to constantly replenish the surface to compensate for the material erosion associated with evaporation and sputtering by plasma ions. To face these challenges, it has been proposed to employ a Capillary-Porous Structure (CPS) to hold the LM in place, avoiding droplet emission and providing passive replenishment -in a similar way as it is done in heat pipes-. From the plasma physics point of view, it has been mentioned that the evaporated metal interacts beneficially with the near-divertor plasma, since it allows to exhaust part of the heat load via line radiation and Bremsstrahlung. Nevertheless, should the metal radiate in the core plasma or excessively dilute it, the fusion reactor performances would be heavily reduced. This thesis is focused on theoretically assessing, based on literature data and simple calculations, the capability of the CPS to hold the LM in place. To this aim, a detailed pressure balance for the LM in the CPS has been performed. Various terms of the balance are evaluated based on conditions expected in a fusion reactor. The simplicity of the model allows for performing fast parametric scans, thereby grasping the effect of design choices and of reactor operating conditions on the LM confinement.",

These beams hit the Plasma Facing Components (PFCs), first wall and divertor, which must be designed in order to withstand the consequent loads, that could otherwise cause phenomena such as erosion or melting, followed by a LOCA (Loss Of Cooling Accident). With the use of the Monte Carlo code FLUKA, the distribution profile of energy deposited by runaway electrons in PFCs has been assessed by ENEA, considering all the possible reactions derived by the collision of the particles inside the materials.  The scope of the present work is to compute the temperature patterns in the EU DEMO divertor and first wall, in order to forecast the presence of one of the unwanted phenomena, starting from the energy profiles computed by ENEA. In first place, all the assumptions made and all the data used to set up the model in the FE solver Freefem++ are illustrated: the choice of the energy deposited and its duration, together with the correlations used for the heat transfer and the ones used for the thermal properties of the materials. At the end, the computed results are highlighted: the analysis has confirmed that, for both the components, large melting can occur, requiring their replacement in case of runaway electron events, but more catastrophic events (as LOCA) are not expected. This work constitutes a good starting point for the analysis of the effects of disruptions in DEMO, which could affect the design of plasma facing components, in order to minimize the maintenance costs of the reactor.",

Model equations are discretized using Galerkin triangular finite elements. Piecewise quadratic (P2) finite-elements are used for the velocity and piecewise linear (P1) for the pressure. The coupled system of equations is integrated in time using a second-order Gear scheme. Non-linearities are treated implicitly and the resulting discrete equations are solved using a Newton algorithm. The numerical method is implemented with the finite elements software FreeFem++ (www.freefem.org), available for all existing operating systems. The programs are written and distributed as an easy-to-use open-source toolbox, allowing the user to code new numerical algorithms for similar problems with phase-change. We present several validations, by simulating classical benchmark cases of increasing difficulty: natural convection of air, melting of a phase-change material, a melting-solidification cycle, a basal melting of a phase-change material, and finally, a water freezing case.",

The problem is set for the case of highly concentrated solute spilled onto soil surface. We investigate the way solute transfer, adsorption of contaminant by soil particles and variable porosity influence infiltration of solute into the soil profile. For that purpose, two models are used: a classical one and the one with consideration of mentioned factors. By comparing the results of both models, we established that high concentration of solute causes moisture transport to transpire more slowly, and the pollutant to remain on the soil surface for longer time. Numerical results indicate that porosity can vary considerably under the conditions of intensive contamination with salts.",

During human locomotion, mechanical stress at the plantar surface is 3D: pressure acting vertically and shear stress acting longitudinally and laterally. The system described here offers gait, foot deformity, diabetic ulceration, and foot-ankle kinetics researchers a means to obtain the full 3D data that is missing in most current research efforts. Surface Stress Sensitive Film™ (S3F) provides the sensing element for this measurement device. S3F is an incompressible elastic film that deforms in response to applied forces. Upon removal of the forces, the film returns to its original shape. The dynamic, 3D deformations are captured with a digital camera. The measured deformations can be analyzed directly, since they are proportional to the applied forces, or used as inputs to a finite element model of the film to reconstruct the pressure and shear force values. System performance is evaluated using both a standard form and human foot contact. The fundamental approach involves comparing the integrated normal and shear loads from the S3F-based sensor to the measurements provided by a force plate. The results showed high linearity (<3% nonlinearity), low uncertainty (<4%), low cross talk (<3%), high spatial resolution (1.6 mm2), no loss of fidelity at walking speeds with a 45 Hz sampling rate, and good repeatability for human foot contact measurements.",

            "abstract": "Although rotating cavity flows are essential components of industrial applications, their dynamics is still largely misunderstood. From computer hard-drives to turbopumps of space launchers, designed devices often produce flow oscillations that can destroy the component prematurely, or produce disturbing noise or undesired operating modes of the system. The fundamentals of encountered static and rotating flow boundary layers have evidenced, a long time ago now, the presence of specific boundary layer instabilities and structures for low Reynolds numbers. For higher Reynolds numbers and fully enclosed systems, features are, however, more complex with the apparition of multifrequency oscillations populating the entire cavity limit cycle. For these flows, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) has illustrated the capacity of reproducing features and limit cycles. However, identifying the origin and region within these flows that are responsible for mode selections remains difficult if not impossible using such computational fluid dynamics tools. The present contribution evaluates a LES and a global stability analysis framework to identify the mechanisms responsible for the observed limit-cycles of two types of rotor-stator cavities. In particular, the presence of a central body or shaft and its impact on the instability selection is of interest here, i.e., the identification of the regions of mode activation for a cylindrical as well as an annular cavity is detailed. Results issued by the conjunct use of dynamical mode decomposition and Global Linear Stability Analysis (GLSA) confirm the observed LES dynamics. Most importantly, GLSA gives access to the triggering mechanisms at the root of the limit-cycles expression as well as hints on the mode selection. In that respect, a cylindrical cavity is shown to sustain more complex features than an annular cavity because of an enhanced flow curvature near the central shaft.",

The present study, focusing on scalar waves in two dimensions, e.g. antiplane shear waves, aims at setting a generic optimization framework. The proposed optimization procedure relies on a number of mathematical and numerical tools. First, the two-scale asymptotic homogenization method is deployed up to second-order to provide an effective dispersive model, valid for low and medium frequencies. Simple dispersion indicators and cost functionals are then considered on the basis of this model. Then, the minimization of these functionals is performed thanks to an algorithm that relies on the concept of topological derivative to iteratively perform phase changes in the unit cell characterizing the material. Finally, FFT-accelerated solvers are extensively used to solve the cell problems underlying the homogenized model. To illustrate the proposed approach, the resulting procedure is applied to the design of anisotropic media with maximal dispersion in specific directions, and to the reconstruction of unknown microstructures from effective phase velocity data. Several extensions are discussed, notably to address microstructured interfaces, elastic waves, and higher frequency regimes.",

Two major patterning theories have been proposed, namely instructional signaling, in which positional information is encoded as a program, and self-organization, in which position is spontaneously acquired within the developing tissue. We review here recent empirical evidence that supports both theories in vertebrates: with the advent of new molecular techniques and functional approaches, researchers nowadays take advantage of natural populations of mammals, birds and fish species, closely-related to model organisms and varying in periodic patterns. As a whole, results strongly suggest that instruction and self-organization act in combination in space and time. The orientation and reproducibility of periodic patterns relies on initial foundations provided by early developmental landmarks while their periodicity and natural variation are shaped by late-acting self-organizing processes.",

This lead to conduction models that can model and predict the behavior of the overall response, but they were not capable of giving fundamental information regarding the basic mechanisms taking place. The study of epitaxial layers is a definite improvement allowing clarifying the different aspects and contributions of the sensing mechanisms. A detailed analytical model of the transduction function for n and p-type single-crystalline/compact metal oxide gas sensors was developed that directly relates the conductance of the sample with changes in the surface electrostatic potential.

We observe capillarity in a minimal model for scalar active matter with purely repulsive interactions, where an effective attraction emerges due to slowdown during collisions between active particles and between active particles and walls. Simulations indicate that the capillary rise in thin tubes is approximately proportional to the active sedimentation length λ and that the wetting height of a vertical plate grows superlinear with λ. In a disordered porous medium the imbibition height scales as〈h〉∝λφm, where φm is its packing fraction.",

An asymptotic-numerical study can be performed for small gaps compared to the flame thickness δT. In this narrow-channel limit, the problem formulation simplifies to a quasi-2D description in which the velocity field is controlled by dominant viscous effects. After accounting for conductive heat losses through the plates in our formulation, we found that the reaction front breaks into one or several isolated flame cells where the temperature is large enough to sustain the reaction, both in absence and in presence of buoyancy effects. Under these near-limit conditions, the isolated flame cells either travel steadily or undergo a slow random walk over the chamber in which the reacting front splits successively to form a tree-like pathway, burning only a small fraction of the fuel before reaching the end of the chamber. The production of quasi-2D circular or comet-like flames under specific favorable conditions is demonstrated in this paper, with convection, conductive heat losses and differential diffusion playing an essential role in the formation of the isolated one and two-headed flame cells.",

Our silicon-based nanopores have embedded vertical field effect transistors (FETs) in the walls of an inverted pyramidal nanopore (npFETs). This geometry was chosen in part because etching allows small pore exit dimensions with length tolerances largely controlled by the surface etch mask while epitaxial growth enables well-defined field effect transistor axial dimensions. This design is fundamentally different from other nanopore detection schemes, which measure current flowing through or across an occupied pore. Other FET detection methods require the adsorption of analytes onto coated surfaces to measure binding, whereas our sensors are designed to respond to the charges present on a passing protein. Molecules are moved through the pore by electro-osmosis force (EOF). Biomolecule analysis is performed as the variations in the charge structure of molecules passing near the FET gate regions cause detectable variations in source-drain current that can be used to characterize the passing molecule. This is possible because the EOF partially descreens the molecules, permitting sensing from distances greater than several Debye lengths. We undertook simulation efforts to better understand the potential of this nanopore design. The finite element simultaneous solution of the Poisson-Nernst-Plank ion transport and Navier-Stokes fluid flow equations was achieved by alternating between iterative Newton solutions until quantities common to both sets of equations were consistent. According to our simulations, the flow dynamics through the pore's constricting geometry force biomolecules of both charges close enough to the sensor surface for detection. In this paper, we present a finite element simulation of narrowing nanopores, the fabrication of such nanopore arrays, and electrical characterization of the embedded npFETs. This work lays the foundation for the future study of individual protein measurements.",

In particular, the new LPS-ROM is a velocity-pressure ROM that uses pressure modes as well to compute the reduced order pressure, needed for instance in the computation of relevant quantities, such as drag and lift forces on bodies in the flow. The new LPS-ROM circumvents the standard discrete inf-sup condition for the POD velocity-pressure spaces, whose fulfillment can be rather expensive in realistic applications in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Also, the velocity modes does not have to be neither strongly nor weakly divergence-free, which allows to use snapshots generated for instance with penalty or projection-based stabilized methods. The numerical analysis of the fully Navier-Stokes discretization for the new LPS-ROM is presented, by mainly deriving the corresponding error estimates. Numerical studies are performed to discuss the accuracy and performance of the new LPS-ROM on a two-dimensional laminar unsteady flow past a circular obstacle.",

Quasi-static energy minimization naturally induces bursty plastic flow and shape change in the crystal due to the underlying coordinated basin-hopping local strain activity. This is mediated by the nucleation, interaction, and annihilation of lattice defects occurring with no need for auxiliary hypotheses. Numerical simulations highlight the marked effect of symmetry on all these processes. The kinematical atlas induced by symmetry on strain space elucidates how the arrangement of the energy extremals and the possible bifurcations of the strain-jump paths affect the plastification mechanisms and defect-pattern complexity in the lattice.",

One challenge of NVB is its applicability to arbitrary simplex grids, which is not possible with the current compatibility condition. We define a novel, more natural weak compatibility condition for the initial grid and show that using this condition the iterative refinement algorithm terminates using NVB. We design an algorithm to relabel an arbitrary d-dimensional simplicial grid to fulfil this weak compatibility condition. The algorithm is of complexity O(n), where n is the number of elements in the grid. We also consider NVB on partitioned grids for parallel computing. Another challenge is that refinement may propagate over partition boundaries. This is resolved by adding an outer loop to the refinement algorithm, that requires global communication. We prove that the amount of global communication needed and the number of outer iterations in the refinement propagation to reach a conforming situation is bounded. We extend the grid manager Dune-ALUGrid to provide parallel, adaptive, conforming 2d grids. Furthermore we develop the software package Dune-ACFem which is able to conveniently describe mathematical problems within efficient C++ code. We demonstrate the utility of Dune-ACFem and Dune-ALUGrid at the problem of noise removal on images with adaptive finite elements.",

In the case of wakes, the marginal stability of the mean flow is well known and had several consequences documented in the literature. To the authors’ knowledge, the marginal stability of mean flows after a symmetry-breaking pitchfork bifurcation is demonstrated here for the first time. As an example of possible consequences of marginal stability, the self-consistent model proposed for wakes in Mantič-Lugo et al. (Phys Rev Lett 113:084501, 2014) and relying on marginal stability is also applied here to the symmetry-breaking instability of the flow in a channel with a sudden expansion. For this specific case, the marginal stability of the mean flow is first demonstrated by dedicated direct numerical simulations; successively, it is shown that the resulting self-consistent model predicts the nonlinear saturation of the instability with remarkable accuracy.",

This need is linked to the time cost of high-fidelity models, rendering them inefficient for applications like multi-disciplinary optimization. With the goal of testing and applying model reduction to computational fluid dynamics models applicable to lifting surfaces, a bibliographical research covering reduction of nonlinear, dynamic, or steady models was conducted. This established the prevalence of projection and least mean squares methods, which rely on solutions of the original high-fidelity model and their proper orthogonal decomposition to work. Other complementary techniques such as adaptive sampling, greedy sampling, and hybrid models are also presented and discussed. These projection and least mean squares methods are then tested on simple and documented benchmarks to estimate the error and speed-up of the reduced order models thus generated. Dynamic, steady, nonlinear, and multiparametric problems were reduced, with the simplest version of these methods showing the most promise. These methods were later applied to single parameter problems, namely the lid-driven cavity with incompressible Navier–Stokes equations and varying Reynolds number, and the elliptic airfoil at varying angles of attack for compressible Euler flow. An analysis of the performance of these methods is given at the end of this article, highlighting the computational speed-up obtained with these techniques, and the challenges presented by multiparametric problems and problems showing point singularities in their domain.",

Robust two-level Schwarz preconditioners exist in the literature to guarantee fast convergence of Krylov methods. As long as the dimension of the coarse space is reasonable, that is, exact solvers can be used efficiently, two-level methods scale well on parallel architectures. However, the factorization of the coarse space matrix may become costly at scale. An alternative is then to use an iterative method on the second level, combined with an algebraic preconditioner, such as a one-level additive Schwarz preconditioner. Nevertheless, the condition number of the resulting preconditioned coarse space matrix may still be large. One of the difficulties of using more advanced methods, like algebraic multigrid or even two-level overlapping Schwarz methods, to solve the coarse problem is that the matrix does not arise from a partial differential equation (PDE) anymore. We introduce in this paper a robust multilevel additive Schwarz preconditioner where at each level the condition number is bounded, ensuring a fast convergence for each nested solver. Furthermore, our construction does not require any additional information than for building a two-level method, and may thus be seen as an algebraic extension.",

In zebrafish oocytes, extensive ooplasmic streaming leads to the segregation of ooplasm from yolk granules along the animal-vegetal axis of the oocyte. Here, we show that this process does not rely on cortical actin reorganization, as previously thought, but instead on a cell-cycle-dependent bulk actin polymerization wave traveling from the animal to the vegetal pole of the oocyte. This wave functions in segregation by both pulling ooplasm animally and pushing yolk granules vegetally. Using biophysical experimentation and theory, we show that ooplasm pulling is mediated by bulk actin network flows exerting friction forces on the ooplasm, while yolk granule pushing is achieved by a mechanism closely resembling actin comet formation on yolk granules. Our study defines a novel role of cell-cycle-controlled bulk actin polymerization waves in oocyte polarization via ooplasmic segregation.",

The programs are written as a toolbox for FreeFem++(www.freefem.org), a free finite-element software available for all existing operating systems.  The code implements a single domain approach. The same set of equations is solved in both liquid and solid phases: the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with Boussinesq approximation for thermal effects. This model describes naturally the evolution of the liquid flow which is dominated by convection effects. To make it valid also in the solid phase, a Carman-Kozeny-type penalty term is added to the momentum equations. The penalty term brings progressively (through an artificial mushy region) the velocity to zero into thesolid. The energy equation is also modified to be valid in both phases using an enthalpy (temperature-transform) model introducing a regularized latent-heat term. Model equations are discretized using Galerkin triangular finite elements. Piecewise quadratic (P2)finite-elements are used for the velocity and piecewise linear (P1) for the pressure. For the temperature both P2 or P1 discretizations are possible. The coupled system of equations is integrated in time using a second-order Gear scheme. Non-linearities are treated implicitly and the resulting discrete equations are solved using a Newton algorithm. An efficient mesh adaptivity algorithm using metrics control is used to adapt the mesh every timestep. This allows us to accurately capture multiple solid-liquid interfaces present in the domain, the boundary-layer structure at the walls and the unsteady convection cells in the liquid. We present several validations of the toolbox, by simulating benchmark cases of increasing difficulty: natural convection of air, natural convection of water, melting of a phase-change material, a melting-solidification cycle, and, finally, a water freezing case. Other similar cases could be easily simulated with this toolbox, since the code structure is extremely versatile and the syntax very close to the mathematical formulation of the model.",

In our framework, a stable variational ultra-weak formulation is adopted, and the equivalence of the L2-norm of the error with the dual graph norm of the residual is established. This dual norm is showed to be localizable over vertex-based patch subdomains of the computational domain under the condition of the orthogonality of the residual to the piecewise affine hat functions. We show that this condition is valid for some well-known numerical methods including continuous/discontinuous Petrov--Galerkin and discontinuous Galerkin methods. Consequently, a well-posed local problem on each patch is identified, which leads to a global conforming reconstruction of the discrete solution. We prove that this reconstruction provides a guaranteed upper bound on the L2 error. Moreover, up to a constant, it also gives local lower bounds on the L2 error, where the generic constant is proven to be independent of mesh-refinement, polynomial degree of the approximation, and the advective velocity. This leads to robustness of our estimates with respect to the advection as well as the polynomial degree. All the above properties are verified in a series of numerical experiments, additionally leading to asymptotic exactness. Motivated by these results, we finally propose a heuristic extension of our methodology to any space dimension, achieved by solving local least-squares problems on vertex-based patches. Though not anymore guaranteed, the resulting error indicator is numerically robust with respect to both advection velocity and polynomial degree, for a collection of two-dimensional test cases including discontinuous solutions.",

The experimental mean velocity profiles are data-assimilated so that they are solutions of the incompressible Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations forced by Reynolds stress terms which are derived from experimental data. Spectral proper orthogonal decompositions (SPOD) of the velocity fluctuations and nonlinear forcing find low-rank behaviour at the shedding frequency and its higher harmonics for the A0 case. In the A10 case, low-rank behaviour is observed for the velocity fluctuations in two bands of frequencies. Resolvent analysis of the data-assimilated means identifies low-rank behaviour only in the vicinity of the shedding frequency for A0 and none of its harmonics. The resolvent operator for the A10 case, on the other hand, identifies two linear mechanisms whose frequencies are a close match with those identified by SPOD. It is also shown that the second linear mechanism, corresponding to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the shear layer, cannot be identified just by considering the time-averaged experimental measurements as a mean flow due to the fact that experimental data are missing near the leading edge. The A0 case is classified as an oscillator where the flow is organised around an intrinsic instability while the A10 case behaves like an amplifier whose forcing is unstructured. For both cases, resolvent modes resemble those from SPOD when the operator is low-rank. To model the higher harmonics where this is not the case, we add parasitic resolvent modes, as opposed to classical resolvent modes which are the most amplified, by approximating the nonlinear forcing from limited triadic interactions of known resolvent modes.",

            "abstract": "This work proposes a feedback-loop strategy to suppress intrinsic oscillations of resonating flows in the fully nonlinear regime. The frequency response of the flow is obtained from the resolvent operator about the mean flow, extending the framework initially introduced by McKeon & Sharma (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 658, 2010, pp. 336–382) to study receptivity mechanisms in turbulent flows. Using this linear time-invariant model of the nonlinear flow, modern control methods such as structured -synthesis can be used to design a controller. The approach is successful in damping self-sustained oscillations associated with specific eigenmodes of the mean-flow spectrum. Despite excellent performance, the linear controller is however unable to completely suppress flow oscillations, and the controlled flow is effectively attracted towards a new dynamical equilibrium. This new attractor is characterized by a different mean flow, which can in turn be used to design a second controller. The method can then be iterated on subsequent mean flows, until the coupled system eventually converges to the base flow. An intuitive parallel can be drawn with Newton’s iteration: at each step, a linearized model of the flow response to a perturbation of the input is sought, and a new linear controller is designed, aiming at further reducing the fluctuations. The method is illustrated on the well-known case of two-dimensional incompressible open-cavity flow at Reynolds number , where the fully developed flow is initially quasiperiodic (2-torus state). The base flow is reached after five iterations. The present work demonstrates that nonlinear control problems may be solved without resorting to nonlinear reduced-order models. It also shows that physically relevant linear models can be systematically derived for nonlinear flows, without resorting to black-box identification from input–output data; the key ingredient being frequency-domain models based on the linearized Navier–Stokes equations about the mean flow. Applicability to amplifier flows and turbulent dynamics has, however, yet to be investigated.",

We propose instead to solve the nonlinear steady equations with the Newton method and to determine the largest growth-rate eigenmodes of the linearized equations using a shift-and-invert spectral transformation and a Krylov–Schur algorithm. The solution of the shifted linearized Navier–Stokes problem, which is the bottleneck of this approach, is computed via an iterative Krylov subspace solver preconditioned by the modified augmented Lagrangian (mAL) preconditioner (Benzi et al., 2011). The well-known efficiency of this preconditioned iterative strategy for solving the real linearized steady-state equations is assessed here for the complex shifted linearized equations. The effect of various numerical and physical parameters is investigated numerically on a two-dimensional flow configuration, confirming the reduced number of iterations over state-of-the-art steady-state and time-stepping-based preconditioners. A parallel implementation of the steady Navier–Stokes and eigenvalue solvers, developed in the FreeFEM language, suitably interfaced with the PETSc/SLEPc libraries, is described and made openly available to tackle three-dimensional flow configurations. Its application on a small-scale three-dimensional problem shows the good performance of this iterative approach over a direct factorization strategy, in regards of memory and computational time. On a large-scale three-dimensional problem with 75 million unknowns, a 80% parallel efficiency on 256 up to 2,048 processes is obtained.",

The lubrication theory is applied to derive the four coupled nonlinear partial differential equations describing the film thickness, surface velocity, and surfactant concentration on the surface and in the bulk. Simulated results showed that the surface elasticity, adsorption coefficient, and surfactant solubility are indispensable factors in the drainage process of a liquid film containing a soluble surfactant. In the initial stage of the drainage, the initial film thickness increases with increasing surface elasticity and the film surface tends to be more rigid. With further drainage, the liquid film exhibits different notable features for high and low elasticity. For low surface elasticity, the surfactant distribution produces a positive Marangoni effect, which counteracts gravity. However, for high surface elasticity, the film surface exhibits a reverse Marangoni effect, which accelerates the drainage and leads to an unstable film. As the solubility decreases, both the film stability and initial surface elasticity enhance. The surface elasticity gradually approaches a limiting dilational elasticity modulus owing to the film thinning. For a large Ks, the film surface is insufficient to produce a strong Marangoni effect and then the liquid film tends to easily destabilize. For a small Ks, the soluble surfactant is similar to an insoluble surfactant, and the film is much thicker in the later stage of the drainage.",

This approximation is done thanks to the Galerkin method which focuses the problem on a reduced zone, divides this zone in non-overlapping subdomains, and approximates on each domain thesolution with easy functions such as polynomials. This method is here applied to financial multi-dimensional problems. Here we consider the pricing of complex derivatives such as basket options on two or three assets, under the Black-Scholes and the Merton model, and the pricing of simple products (plain vanillas) under complex models such as stochastic volatility models. This financial problems involve in general two or three dimensional parabolic PDEs or PIDEs.

            "abstract": "The operator splitting approach applied to the Navier-Stokes equations, gave rise to various numerical methods for the simulations of the dynamics of fluids. The separate work of Chorin and Temam on this subject gave birth to the so-called projection methods. The basic projection schemes, either the incremental or non-incremental variant (see [1]) induces an artificial Neumann boundary condition on the pressure. By getting rid of this boundary condition on the pressure, the so-call rotational incremental pressure-correction scheme as proposed by Timmermans et al. [2] for Newtonian fluids with constant viscosity gives a consistent equation for the pressure. In this work we propose a family of projection methods for generalized Newtonian fluids based on an extension of the rotational projection scheme. Called shear rate projections, these methods produces consistent pressure when applied to generalized Newtonian fluids. Accuracy of the methods will be illustrated using a manufactured solution. Numerical experiments for the flow past a cylinder, with aCarreau rheological model, will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "The mitigation of the precessing vortex core developing in the draft tube of Francis turbines operating under part load conditions is crucial to increase the operation flexibility of these hydraulic machines to balance the massive power production of intermittent energy sources. A systematic approach following the optimal control theory is, therefore, presented to control this vortical flow structure. Modal analysis characterizes the part load vortex rope as a self-sustained instability associated with an unstable eigenmode. Based on this physical characteristic, an objective function targeting a zero value of the unstable eigenvalue growth rate is defined and subsequently minimized using an adjoint-based optimization algorithm. We determine an optimal force distribution that successfully quenches the part load vortex rope and sketches the design of a realistic control appendage.",

            "abstract": "A two-dimensional mathematical model for coupled heat and mass transfer during convective drying of feijoa (Acca sellowiana Berg) slices was implemented. The thermophysical and transport properties were considered variable and the effective moisture diffusion coefficient was determined based on the Arrhenius-type temperature dependence. The convective heat and mass transfer coefficients were obtained from the minimization of the function in terms of the error of experimental and predicted data. The model was solved by means of the finite element method programmed in FreeFEM. This is a free software that has not been reported for fruit convective drying modelling, but this software can be used for drying modelling in fruits. The model was validated against experimental data for air velocities of 0.5 and 1 ms−1, temperatures of 50, 60, and 70 °C and slice thicknesses of 0.003 and 0.005 m through Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (ρc). Which has not been reported for validation in drying modelling though it is a reliable indicator of model agreement. Experimental data were well predicted with the model, with concordance correlation coefficients of 0.9653 and 0.9872 for moisture content and temperature, respectively. The model was found to be suitable to describe, with sufficient accuracy, the heat and mass transfer during drying, and hence, it is appropriate for engineering applications.",
