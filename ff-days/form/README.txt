HOW TO USE

The most important files in the zipped template is the index.html file 
in the root folder and the CSS files in the /css/ folder. This contains 
all of the HTML markup and appropriate CSS needed to recreate the form 
you saw in the Wufoo Form Gallery.

Edit the index.html in your favorite text editor or web development suite
to your liking and if you want, you can use this template with CSS themes 
available from the Wufoo CSS Theme Gallery (http://www.wufoo.com/gallery/designs/)
to customize the look and feel of your form.
